# Yes you can use both to do math

# strings are when charcters are enclosed in quotation marks to be defined or to be printed

# A list can contain data like numbers items people places pretty much anything that can be listed

mylist = ["Apples","Pears","Watermelons","Mangos"]
mylist.append("Tangerines")
print(mylist)
mylist.remove("Apples")
print(mylist)

print(len(mylist))

# The two main things that i learned that are new in this lab were the substrings and lists. All the different things to remove add and do different things to lists i think will be helpfull in the future. The substring was interesting in how you could pick out a specific charcator from a long string which could be usefull.
