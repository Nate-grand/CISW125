# This program should add three numbers together.

# Removed the total equals inbetween the input statements.

num1 = int(input("What's the first number? >"))

num2 = int(input("What's the second number? >"))

num3 = int(input("What's the third number? >"))

# Changed total equals num3 to adding all the nums together.

total = num1 + num2 + num3
print(f"Total is: {total}")
